TODO features:
- If you plan to reset a scene or level, consider exposing a .reset() method in Storage that calls chunkIdPool.reset() and clears all internal maps. This would make recycling the whole world easier without creating new instances.
- EntityMetaSet should be instanciated via SparseSet
- fix the interp angles for smooth rotation
- if chunk is full upload the whole thing? (no subarrays)
- make consistent error messaging across the codebase
- add an updateEntity in Scene
- make the archetypes map in Scene a Graphinstead of a Map for fast search
- no need anymore the Renderer file in gl
- in GUI if store hasn't changed, there's no need to render
- the renderer resize doesn't fucking work
- the renderer graphics looks blurry
- static and dynamic layering to add
- write unit tests for everything
