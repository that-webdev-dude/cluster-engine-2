TODO:

- add an optional component initialization parameter to Storage.allocate
- implement the deferred update feature in the storage. allocate and delete should not be allowed during a foreach lop
- implement an IDManager for creation and deletion of ids (this can be used in the storage)
    â†’ maybe this can have the genetation encoding?
- make the Archetype a generic so the Storage works with generics
