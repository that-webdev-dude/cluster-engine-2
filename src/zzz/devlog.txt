TODO:

- âœ… add an optional component initialization parameter to Storage.allocate 
- âœ… replace the ComponentUnit array for a map map-like object with keys as ComponentType enum members (or strings like "Position") 
- implement the deferred update feature in the storage. allocate and delete should not be allowed during a foreach lop
- âœ… implement an IDPool for creation and deletion of ids (this can be used in the storage)
    â†’ ðŸŸ¦ maybe this can have the generation encoding?
- make the Archetype a generic so the Storage works with generics
- should each Archetype own its Storage?
- If you plan to reset a scene or level, consider exposing a .reset() method in Storage that calls chunkIdPool.reset() and clears all internal maps. This would make recycling the whole world easier without creating new instances.
