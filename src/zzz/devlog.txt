TODO:

- âœ… implement an IDPool for creation and deletion of ids (this can be used in the storage)
    â†’ ðŸŸ¦ maybe this can have the generation encoding?
- make the Archetype a generic so the Storage works with generics
- If you plan to reset a scene or level, consider exposing a .reset() method in Storage that calls chunkIdPool.reset() and clears all internal maps. This would make recycling the whole world easier without creating new instances.
- EntityMetaSet should be instanciated via SparseSet
- in renderer system refactor common consider- in camera archetype add position and prev position for smooth movement + adjustthe systems

- make a unique mesh pipeline if possible
- fix the interp angles for smooth rotation
- time to import Cmath
